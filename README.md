# zephir_php7_extension

I created two images for the PHP 7 extension developement one with ubuntu-18 and the other one with alpine-3.11, because alpine image is quit small in size.

[ubuntu-18.04_and_PHP-7.2](https://github.com/vijaydohare/zephir_php7_extension/tree/master/ubuntu-18.04_and_PHP-7.2)

[alpine-3.11_and_PHP-7.3](https://github.com/vijaydohare/zephir_php7_extension/tree/master/alpine-3.11_and_PHP-7.3)
